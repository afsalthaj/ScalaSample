When is not Covariant?
As soon as the generic parameter type appears as the type of the method parameter, the containing class
or trait may not be covariant in the type parameter


Lower bound
you can generalise the function by making it polymorphic and using a lower bound for its type parameter.


ContraVariant:
// Refer chapter 19 page no: 402
