## supaku-sukara
I love Japan and the Japanese language - interestingly, its pure and simple enough (not a linguist though), just like functional programming in Scala should be! In Japanese, Sukara is Scala and Supaku is Spark.

### Why Supaku-Sukara
Supaku-Sukara explains Scala (from a functional programming perspective, and not syntax) and Spark. I am developing the project for personal purpose of learning, and with an intend to share it with my friends in future.

#### Why Functional Program in Scala? (Sukara, Kansūkei puroguramingu)
The greatest advantage of keeping your code aligned with functional program paradigm is to enable stable, consistent, performant, and reliable parallelism with no chance of any state mutation even with multi-thread processes. One of the prominent use cases of parallelism is in Big Data platforms, where the program runs on big chunks of data distributed across different computing nodes. 

#### Why Spark (Supaku)?
While Scala can be a handy language for us to develop pure functional code, Spark provides us with a fast and reliable cluster computing platform (with APIs written in Scala) that runs our pure functional logic (or even as standalone or pseudo) to handle big data. 

#### Why to start with Functional Programming?
If you have got a sense of Functional Programming in Scala, it is fairly easy for you to undersand the fundamental concepts behind the explanations in O'Reilly Spark with in a few days of time.
