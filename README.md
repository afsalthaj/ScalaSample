ScalaSample
===========
This is a Sample Scala Project, which can be kick-start for those who are interested in Scala.
The fundamentals has been discussed using examples and concepts are segmented in different packages.
Short description has been provided in all classes,traits etc explaining each concept.
User will get an idea of basic scala language, list, map, loops, if-else statements, exception handling, pattern matching, traits, abstract classes, scala concurrency, scala Actors etc.
Going through the short descriptions and code intitially, and then learning each concept in detail will make it easier for you to develop in Scala later on.
