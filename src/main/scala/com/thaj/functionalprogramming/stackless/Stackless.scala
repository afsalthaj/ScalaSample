     * Ok.. What does this mean? Once your description is created, where building
     * up description didn't involve any sort of run or didn't fill up the stack
     * because each step yields a trampoline and it stops there. The final interpretation
     * is done by the above run method. You must be wondering why the function
     * consist of `var` and mutations. As mentioned, this is a demonstration purpose.
     * It shows that the final runT method doesn't involve any filling up stack with
     * any frames to remember any state of any step. You would easily guess that
     * the above ugly code can be replaced with the below tail recursive call which
     * is elegant - and yes! that's exactly the same.

     * *
     * The point here is, your description doesn't take up
     * any stack, and so is the interpreter too. This is the basics of trampoline's
     * interpreter.
