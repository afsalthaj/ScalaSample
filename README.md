ScalaSample
===========
This is a Sample Scala Project - a kick-start for those who are interested in Scala.
The fundamentals are discussed using examples and scala concepts are segmented in different packages.
Short descriptions provided in all classes,traits etc explaining each concept.

Also, covers the solutions for exercises in functional programming.

Concepts Discussed:

1. basic scala language,
2. list
3. map
4. loops
5. if-else statements
6. exception handling
7. pattern matching
8. traits
9. abstract classes
10. scala concurrency, scala Actors etc.

Going through the short descriptions (comments), and then learning each concept in detail will make it easier for you to develop in Scala later on.
Including scalaz operations also
