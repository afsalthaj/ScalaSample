#### What's in part2?

```
val outputList = parMap(inputList)(f)
```

Towards the end of the chapter
weâ€™ll develop a combinator, parMap, that will let us easily apply a function f to
every element in a collection simultaneously.

While doing this, you will come to know how to design a purely functional library (of parallel computations)
